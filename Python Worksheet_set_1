Programming Questions 

Q11. Write a python program to find the factorial of a number.

Factorial of a Number
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

# Example usage
num = 5
print(f"The factorial of {num} is {factorial(num)}")

Q12. Write a python program to find whether a number is prime or composite.
Prime or Composite Number
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return "Neither prime nor composite"
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return "Composite"
    return "Prime"

# Example usage
num = 29
print(f"{num} is {is_prime(num)}")

Q13.Write a python program to check whether a given string is palindrome or not.
  Palindrome Check
  def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

# Example usage
string = "radar"
print(f"The string '{string}' is a palindrome: {is_palindrome(string)}")

Q14. Write a Python program to get the third side of a right-angled triangle from two given sides.
  Third Side of Right-Angled Triangle
  import math

def find_third_side(a, b):
    return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)

# Example usage
a = 3
b = 4
print(f"The third side of the triangle is {find_third_side(a, b)}")

Q15. Write a python program to print the frequency of each of the characters present in a given string.
  Frequency of Characters in a String
  def char_frequency(s):
    freq = {}
    for char in s:
        if char in freq:
            freq[char] += 1
        else:
            freq[char] = 1
    return freq

# Example usage
string = "hello world"
print(f"The frequency of characters in '{string}' is {char_frequency(string)}")
